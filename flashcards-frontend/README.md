# Flashcards App

## Introduction
Flashcards App is a simple web-based application, where the user can create a custom flashcard set for learning.

It's a personal project where I'm practising using the following technologies: React and Material UI for the front-end;
Node.js and Express for the back-end; and SQLite for database management.

## Technologies
- Front-End: React, Material UI
- Back-End: Node.js, Express
- Database: SQLite

## Project Status
Currently, the project is in the initial setup phase. The front-end and back-end directories have been created,
and some basic front-end configurations are in place. Back-end does not exist yet.

## Setup
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lottasep/flashcards-app.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd flashcards-app

# Install dependencies for the front-end
cd flashcards-frontend
npm install

# Run the front-end development server
cd ../flashcards-frontend
npm run dev

# The front-end will be available at localhost:3000 (or the port specified by Vite)
